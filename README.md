Lizbet Ortiz, Juan Rios, Tianqi Zhao

## Project Summary

This GitHub repository contains an in-depth analysis of industrial emissions and their impact on public health in Cancer Alley, Louisiana. Cancer Alley is an area with a high concentration of industrial facilities along the Mississippi River, raising concerns about its residents' health.

## Key Highlights

- We analyzed the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality's (LDEQ) emissions inventory dataset to understand the impact of emissions on public health.

- **Emissions Quantification Methods:** The LDEQ employs direct measurement, calculation, and modeling to quantify emissions. Data limitations include outdated equipment and incomplete data, which may lead to underestimation of pollutants.

- **Cancer-causing Chemicals:** We highlighted chemicals recognized as carcinogens by the NIH and NTP.

- **Project Focus: Ascension and Calcasieu Counties:** We focused on trends in 15 selected cancer-causing pollutants.

- **Data Analysis:** Visualizations illustrate changes in pollutant emissions and concentrations over time in these counties.

- **Further Work:** Future investigations should explore facility types, reasons for non-pollutant facility reduction, and other pollutants' impact.

This repository offers insights for informed decision-making and policy development to reduce pollution and protect public health and the environment in Cancer Alley, Louisiana.
